# Arxiv Feed
Tool to pull the latest papers from arxiv and make them available for vector and keyword search queries.



## TODOs
- Add negatives to embedding queries
- Add generate missing embeddings button to webui? might just want to keep this as a commandline thing
- Save chunked embbeddings immediately so a crash doesn't lose them. (This will also fix a bug where a single bad chunk results in no embeddings getting saved)
